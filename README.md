## About corpus

The Spoken corpus of the dialects of Khakas contains transcribed annotated texts, synchronized with the sound. The texts were recorded during the 21st century with speakers born in 1916-1985 in different expeditions from Moscow to the Republic of Khakassia. All texts are translated to Russian. Texts were analyzed using the automatic parser, and then edited and synchronized with the sound with the help of the ELAN software.
